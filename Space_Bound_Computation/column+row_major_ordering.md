### Row and Column Major Ordering
   
   Row Major Ordering and Column Major Ordering are methods that you use to store arrays in a computers RAM. They both do the same task, 
store the array elements RAM, but they store the elements diffferently. The image below, from craftofcoding.wordpress.com, gives us the best visual of what it is:

They two are basically the same thing, like before. The only difference between the two is that in a 2D array, per say a matrix, the RAM saves
the data row-by-row in Row Major Ordering and by columns in Column Major Ordering. Take second look at the photo above. Say there is a 3x3
array containing the digits from 1 to 9. With Row Major Ordering, the data will be saved, like 123 (row one) the 456 (row two) and so on. In
Column Major Ordering, the data will be saved by columns, like 147 (column one), 258 (colunm two) and so on
