### Does it matter if the for loops are switched?
To answer that question, yes it does matter. This is because it changes the output. Say there are two martices, called A and B. If the loops
where to stay the same, you would be multiplying A * B. However, if the two loops were switched, it would not be same; you would be multiplying
B * A, which is completely different. In the first one, you would be taking the vertical for A and multiplying/adding it to the horizontial of B,
while in the second one you would be taking the vertical for B and multiplying/adding it to the horizontial of A, which will give out a completely 
different answer. 

As long as run time goes, they take the **same time to run**. This is because you are doing the same action to both of the list, no matter the
way you combine them.
